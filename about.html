                    <p> The Toronto District School Board (TDSB) is the largest 
                        educational institution in Canada. It represents over 250,000 
                        students collectively from 473 elementary, 110 secondary, and 
                        5 adult education schools. The TDSB vows to meet the needs of 
                        its schools, staff, families, and communities with its lofty 
                        budget of $3.4 billion in the 2019-2020 school year. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In August 2020, the TDSB made headlines when it announced that 
                        its reopening plan would implement a quadmester system, meaning 
                        students would learn two new courses every two months. TDSB 
                        students experienced a massive change as they were used to 
                        semester and non-semester systems. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On Wednesday, May 12th, 2021, the TDSB announced schools will 
                        continue with the quadmester system for the 2021/2022 school year. 
                        We students have decided to take a stand. We cannot continue to 
                        learn like this for another year. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Learning in quadmesters is mentally and physically draining. We 
                        are not able to properly learn and digest the information provided 
                        in our courses in such a brief period of time. Quadmesters  
                        highlight everything that is wrong with the TDSB's outdated education 
                        system. Students are not learning; we are just merely memorizing 
                        information. Not to mention the extreme stress students have been 
                        under, every waking moment, due to the quad system. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This petition calls on the Toronto District School Board to adopt a 
                        semester model of learning for the upcoming school year. Students 
                        will not be able to handle another year of quads. They are detrimental 
                        to our mental health and academics. We will not stand for another 
                        year of quadmesters! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Send this to your friends, family, and fellow classmates. The more 
                        signatures we get the more likely it is for the TDSB to hear us loud 
                        and clear! The Toronto District School Board has decided to reintroduce 
                        quadmesters, a system which both students and teachers are unsatisfied 
                        with. This is a student-led movement urging the TDSB to consider adopting 
                        a semestered schedule instead.
